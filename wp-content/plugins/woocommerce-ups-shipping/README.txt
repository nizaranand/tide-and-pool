*** MAKE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN that you set a weight, length, width, and height for every product in your store that requires shipping!
*** If you do not do that then UPS cannot calculate shipping rates and so shipping will appear to be free!
*** DO NOT CONTACT SUPPORT UNLESS YOU'VE VERIFIED PRODUCT SETTINGS ***


*** DO NOT MIX UNITS OF MEASUREMENT. EITHER USE ALL USA MEASUREMENTS ( pounds / inches ) OR ALL METRIC MEASUREMENTS ( kilograms / centimeter )
*** If you mix units of measurements UPS will not return rate quotes.
*** DO NOT CONTACT SUPPORT UNLESS YOU'VE VERIFIED SHIPPING SETTINGS ***



*** NOTE ***
A notice will appear asking you to install the IgniteWoo Updater plugin ( if you
have not already done so ). The plugin enables you to receive plugin updates and support.
Click the link to install the Updater and activate the plugin. Then navigate to
Dashboard -> IgniteWoo Licenses to add your license key, which you should have received
via email. Your license keys are also listed on your My Account page at IgniteWoo.com
